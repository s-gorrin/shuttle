starting map size (number of minos * number of minos plus 1 for newlines, plus one for \0):
	map = (char *)malloc(sizeof(*map) * ((mino_count * mino_count + 1) + 1));

mino adjuster, for maps bigger than 4x4:
	for numbers 0-3, add 0
	for numbers 5-7, add (row length - 4) (row length is before the \n)
	for numbers 10-11, add (row length - 3)
	for number 15, add (row length - 2)

for a 2x2 map, if the piece is the square, just return the full square.

for 3x3 maps (possible with two pieces):
	5-7: subtract 1
	10,11: subtract 2
